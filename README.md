# Association-Pattern-Mining-for-Related-Character-Tags-on-Danbooru

Association Analysis using the pyFIM algorithm has shown to be a relevant method of generating associated tags on the basis of an image’s character tag for the Danbooru image aggregator site. Characters have definite features associated with their design and this is not fully considered by Danbooru’s current methodology for suggesting Related Tags which utilizes the cosine distance of a particular tag’s use count. We filtered the dataset to test our usecase on the 5 most popularly tagged characters and 5 undertagged characters which we determined based on the distribution of those characters' tags. Using Confidence from pyFIM’s arules method as a metric, we generated suggested tagsets for each of those characters' tags. We then compared pyFIM's generated tagsets with the current tags on each of the characters Related Tags page and compared the sets using the Jaccard similarity index. The generated tags produced a better description of each of the character's features in general tags validating the methodology of our usecase.
